# SPSCommerce/typescript

## What?

About 10 years ago, AirBnB's engineers said "Everyone writes JavaScript a little differently. We finally decided it was time that we got together and agree on how we write JavaScript." SPS Commerce engineers have felt the same way for almost as long, but at this point we write Typescript instead of Javascript and we decided to focus on taking what we feel are the best parts of the AirBnB guide and make it our own.

## Why?

Our goal is to ensure that similar syntax and developer experience exists across teams and projects at SPS Commerce.

## How?

This is the hard part to write, but we'll get there soon...

## Who?

The work to define this guide and choose which rules were include was done by the SPS Frontend Architecture Working group in 2021.
